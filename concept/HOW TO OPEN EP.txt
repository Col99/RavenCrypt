The .EP file is a Pencil sketch.
You can get pencil @ http://pencil.evolus.vn/
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencil_Project
Or from here as a firefox addon:
https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/pencil/

I also saved it as a crappy png file.


This is a rough sketch on how things work, but should be moved to into document later.
I hope to create an RFC from it later, but maybe iam not the right guy to do this and
i would have no idea where to start.
